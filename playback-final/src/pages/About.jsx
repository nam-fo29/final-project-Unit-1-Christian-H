                <br></br>I have spent many years wishing that an app like this existed. A singular place to record everything you watch, everything you read, everything you listen to, everything you experience. One place to look for all of your memories.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>In a bar on a December evening in 2018, I had a conversation with my friends about what movies we had seen that year. We all struggled to remember what had even released that year. After looking up a list of everything that had released in 2018, we went through it and finally began our discussion.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>It was that conversation that made me decide that it was time to keep track of everything. I created a list in my Notes app on my phone in January and began recording every piece of media that I experienced. The list grew to include more categories as the years went by - but it started the same way as PlayBack.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>Movies - TV - Video Games - Books
                <br></br>
                <br></br>I have immensely enjoyed looking back at my list at the end of each year. Remembering watching some of my favorite movies or playing some of my favorite games. When was the last time I watched all of the extended editions of Lord of the Rings? (2022 and I'm due for a rewatch).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>I hope you enjoy PlayBack as much as I have enjoyed creating it. Stay tuned for more features in the future!</p>
